  Hi there, welcome!
  President B here, thanks for dropping by.
  We are a non-profit organization that
  works together with environmental and agricultural
  scientists, to help improve and sustain the lives of our bees.
  We stand proudly behind our little friends,
  because they play a HUGE role in cultivating our crops.
  It is vital that we protect these creatures at all costs
  so that they can pollinate our crops and plants!

<h3> Our Mission is to teach others about the importance of bees, and how to love them from afar</strong></em>

<h3>Honey bees</h3>

<p>Honey bees are incredibly social insects that live in colonies that consist of three types of bees; drone bees (that collect pollen), worker bees that produce honey, and the Queen. You can recognise these bees from their golden yellow and brown stripes. Luckily, these guys will only still if provoked. </p>
<h3>Bumble bees </h3>

<p>These cute fluffy friends are round short and stubby. For their body size, they have very tiny, stubby wings. These bees are not aggressive, and you can recognise them from their bright yellow and black stripes. </p>
<h3>Carpenter bees</h3>

<p>Carpenter bees resemble the Bumble bee. They make their homes by chewing away at wood and creating small tunnels. They are most commonly found in unpainted wood, such as wooden decks, wooden roofs, outdoor furniture. Because of the nature of these bees, they often cause structural damage to wooden homes. </p>
<h3>Yellow Jackets</h3>

<p> Yellow Jackets is a type of wasp. They are extremely so social which can turn into aggression easily if provoked. These wasps are very protective of their nest, so it’s good to stay clear if one is spotted. One interesting fact about yellow jackets are that in the summertime, they are carnivores, whereas in the wintertime, they are herbivores.</p>
<h3>Hornets</h3>

<p>Hornets are wasps that are very social and can be aggressive it provoked. They make their homes from chewed wood pulp. A hornet’s stings can be very dangerous. The venom that is injected into its victim can cause an allergic reaction.</p>
